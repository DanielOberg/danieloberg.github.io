Hi and welcome to my musings.

I'm a driven and dedicated data scientist and software engineer (M.Sc.) with experience from both the public and private sectors. Soft spot for fraud analytics, anti-money laundering, functional programming (especially Haskell), machine learning and compiler construction.

The present main expertise lies in Python, C++ and Swift. With a Masters in computer science I have a well-founded understanding of advanced algorithms and also practical experience in machine learning.

Perceived as a positive and responsible person with good communication skills.
