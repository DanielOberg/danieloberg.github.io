      At the age of 12 I started coding in **Pascal**/Delphi after getting the Delphi IDE on a CD by a 
      classmate that had heard I did websites. At this time we where one of the lucky few in my 
      municipality to have a 14.4k modem in our neighborhood.
      This culminated in an automatic MP3-tagger using the Musicbrainz library and a strong 
      passion for programming.

      Learned **C++**. This is what I needed to make games internet assured me.

      Got accepted to the highest regarded university in Sweden, **Royal Institute of Technology** (KTH), where
      I got my **masters in Computer Science** . Still consider this to be one of the luckiest breaks in my life.
      In my final master thesis I presented _deep vein thrombosis (DVT) assesments using Support Vector Machines_ . 
      As Wells Score is extremely 
      simplistic it should easily be replaced by even a linear SVM as our tests show but our main focus has 
      been on support vector machines with an RBF kernel.

        Created a video analysis group in a state sponsered gambling company (Svenska Spel), for scanning coupons, in which I did machine learning and 
        performance tuning in C++ (checking that the resulting assembly where using neon assembly amongst other 
        things). Responsible for barcode-location on the GPU (OpenGL) as well as our own OCR engine, based 
        on **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. Went from using a commercial product that had support for eight betslips 
        to our own which was able to support 52 with or own OCR and binary classifications.

Hi
============

Hi and welcome to my musings.

I'm a driven and dedicated data scientist and software engineer (M.Sc.) with experience from both the public and private sectors. Soft spot for fraud analytics, anti-money laundering, functional programming (especially Haskell), machine learning and compiler construction.
